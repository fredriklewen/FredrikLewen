                <b>I am currently in my 9th semester</b> of studying industrial engineering and management at Linköping University, with a focus on computer science and digitalization. The computer science program has sparked my interest in software development, and the digitalization and management courses cover many relevant areas, from modern business models and digital marketing to web 3.0 and e-commerce.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>I find the IT industry very interesting,</b> and I think I can contribute with creativity, a structured approach, and logical thinking. Software development is the most exciting part of my education, and I cannot wait to participate in real-world IT projects. 
                <!-- I am, so far, primarily focused on front-end development. -->

                <!-- I find the IT industry very interesting, and I can't wait to contribute with
                my structural approach and logical thinking. Developing web applications has
                without a doubt been the most fun part of my education and it would be really
                exciting to see how companies are working with IT projects.
                As I'm getting closer to graduating, I'm now looking for jobs and internships at companies that I'm
                really interested in and curious about. -->

                    When I'm not studying, I love to make music and run my own business project. 
                    By producing and mixing, I get to use my creativity, and by managing the entire 
                    business side of it, I'm continuously developing new useful skills.

                    <b>As a person,</b> I am ambitious, organized, and responsible. I like to learn new things and I am good at listening, so I often develop new skills quickly. Another aspect that helps me grow is my persistence and patience. Completing tasks and being confident in my deliverables brings me a sense of fulfillment, whether it is work, school, or music. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to spend the time I have after studies and exercising on music production to express my creativity. I release my own music, work on projects for a distribution company for use in TV and film, and run an online store selling instrumental beats to other artists. This has given me many valuable experiences in digital business and marketing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you may have noticed, I like to create stuff. Whether it's music, a website, 
                    or a small business, I always enjoy the process of creating from scratch.
                    <b>What can we create together?</b>
