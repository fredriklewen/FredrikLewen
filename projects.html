        <h2>Web Application with Customer Focus</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A project course where I, along with 28 course mates, developed the front-end for a web application
                    for Region Östergötland to help solve their problems with material handling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Valuable to gain insight into all aspects of the development process through involvement in
                    everything from customer meetings and requirement specifications to design and development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inspiring to work in a motivated team towards a common goal of creating the best possible solution
                    for the customer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The group was divided into departments and cross-functional teams, where my main role was a
                    developer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the application, we used React and TypeScript to create a scalable solution for both mobile and
                    desktop
                    using components and modules.

        <h2>E-Commerce Application with a Focus on Navigability</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>As part of my bachelor's thesis, I developed an e-commerce application from scratch with a group of
                    seven people to investigate how navigability can be affected by different design decisions.</li>
                <li>Work was based on a market analysis, user testing, and user behavior data of the target audience to
                    iteratively develop and optimize navigability from the perspective of the target audience.</li>
                <li>I worked with both front-end and back-end and used Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, together
                    with frameworks such as JQuery, Bootstrap and Flask.</li>

            <p>
                As a part of my bachelor thesis, I developed a dynamic e-commerce web application
                together with six classmates. This was a large project spanning over five months and
                it included many steps, from doing a market analysis to designing and developing the
                website from scratch, based on the results from the analysis. We used Python and SQL
                for the back-end, and HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the front-end development.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project opened my eyes for web development and made me interested in learning
                more. I'm currently studying web development to gain deeper understanding in the
                technologies and tools to create more professional web applications on my own.

        <h2>Music business</h2>

            </div>
            <div class="text-div">
                <p>
                    After producing music for many years and releasing several tracks independently,
                    I wanted to try building a side business around it. I signed with a label to
                    release production music (for use in TV, film, and commercials) through Universal
                    and started running an online store, where I consistently publish new music for
                    sale. I use digital platforms to market and receive purchases from artists who
                    need instrumentals to rap or sing over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hobby business has given me lots of new skills and tools related to digital
                    business and internet marketing. I have designed and coded a responsive
                    <a href="https://www.freobeats.com/" target="_blank">website</a>
                    for my business, started an email list, worked with SEO (search engine optimization),
                    and created video content to gain exposure on social platforms. I recently managed
                    to get my music played on British top TV channel BBC One, which is a nice
                    acknowledgement of the effort and consistency put into it.
