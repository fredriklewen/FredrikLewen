                A master of science degree with a mixed focus on technology and business administration.
                My goal is to gain a broad and valuable understanding in both of these worlds.
                As a technical specialization, I'm studying computer technology, and my master is
                focused on digitization and management.

                thesis consisted of developing an e-commerce web application together with six classmates

                Technological program with a focus on industrial production and entrepreneurship. Besides the
                technology
                courses included in the program, I also chose the technological specialization. Ran a student-run

            <h3>ABB & Enics (summer internships)</h3>
            <p>
                Worked in different production chains assembling electronic components such as
                push buttons and circuit boards.
                Learned a lot about the use of standards and quality control in production, and
                got insight into how certain processes work in global industrial firms.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Enics, I quickly became responsible for the last step in the production before
                delivery to the customer, which included testing of the products. It required
                knowledge in all stages of the production line and good communication skills to
                fix the problems that occured.

            <h3>Installation of fire alarms (summer internship)</h3>
            <p>
                Installed fire alarms in school buildings. The assignment came with great
                responsibility, as the supervisor was mainly working in other parts of the
                country. Communication with external parties, such as electricians and painters,
                was an important part of the responsibility due to tight deadlines.
